## Description

FEELS GOOD MAN. Pepe the Frog, created by Matt Furie and first appearing in the comic 'Boyâ€™s Club', is portrayed as one of four post-college twenty-something slackers living together. Over time, this character evolves into a viral Internet meme and is appropriated by the alt-right. In response, Furie seeks to reclaim Pepe, who has been transformed from a comic figure into a hate symbol. The film examines whether Pepe can ultimately be redeemed.
