Support for grant proposals with a computational component.
<!--more-->

Are you (planning on) writing a grant proposal that involves a computational component? Please reach out if you feel that the Societal Analytics Lab could help strengthen your proposal.

Ways in which we could be of service:

* Consultancy on what methods are appropriate and competitive

* Providing feedback on feasibility and formulation

* Vowing to support the research with resources and expertise

Please, keep in mind that if you need more than just a one time meeting, then you would have to acknowledge the Lab and/or the lab member that is helping you. This depends on the amount of time we invest and it can go from just writing a line in the acknowledgments section to adding the person as co-author.
