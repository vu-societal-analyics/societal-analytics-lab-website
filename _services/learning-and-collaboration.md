We promote computational knowledge exchange and foster global connections.
<!--more-->

At the societal analytics lab we aim to serve as a nexus for connecting various relevant skills in the area of computational analysis.

Our goal is to help social scientists acquire important computing skills. 

We know that in contemporary academia, scientists have little time to invest in learning something new! Therefore, we offer three options: [Collaboration](#collaboration), [R Material](#r-material), and [R Workshops](#r-workshops).

## Collaboration

If you find yourself in need of an expert opinion or support on a particular topic, please let us know. If you are a lab member and find yourself in possession of a set of skills that you believe could benefit others, please let us know.

We would like to foster a collaboration network where we and other Lab members can speed-up science by exchanging ideas, knowledge, and skills.

## R Material

We maintain a repository and a book with R course material. The topics range from data wrangling to text analysis and advanced statistics. Feel free to use them as you please, and to contact us for any questions or requests.

The material was initially developed by [Wouter van Atteveldt](https://societal-analytics.nl/team/wouter-van-atteveldt/) and [Kasper Welbers](https://societal-analytics.nl/team/kasper-welbers/), but nowadays is also maintained by other Lab members. 

You can find all the information here: 

* [R course material](https://github.com/ccs-amsterdam/r-course-material/tree/master)
* [Communication Science R Book](https://vu-communication-science.github.io/R-canon/)


## R Workshops

We offer R-workshops specially designed for social scientists. They were developed by [Sofia Gil-Clavel](https://societal-analytics.nl/team/sofia-gil-clavel/), who has many years of experience teaching R to demographers and social scientists from different backgrounds (qualitative and quantitative).

You can find all the course information [here](https://github.com/SofiaG1l/R_Course/tree/master/R4SocialScientists).
