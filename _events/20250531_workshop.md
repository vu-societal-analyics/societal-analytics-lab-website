title: "[hybrid]R-Workshop: Basic concepts before code-parallelization in R"
date: 2025-04-29
---

This is the second-to-last workshop in the R-series. The final session will focus on using servers for parallel processing. 
To get the most out of it, we recommend first completing "Basic concepts before code-parallelization in R", which is an introduction to pseudo-code, bifurcation statements, and loops. 

**When:** May 31st between 9:30-12:30hrs

**Where:** 

* Onsite: If more than 4 people register onsite, otherwise, will be fully online.
* Online: The Zoom link will be sent via email.

**To register:** Register here: [https://forms.office.com/e/xBY9gP3upc](https://forms.office.com/e/xBY9gP3upc)

## Requirements

* It is necessary to have R and RStudio installed before the session. You can do it from here: [https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).

* It is necessary to know the basics of data handling. In February, we covered this topic. You can check the material here: [https://github.com/SofiaG1l/R_Course/tree/master/R4SocialScientists](https://github.com/SofiaG1l/R_Course/tree/master/R4SocialScientists)

## Learning Outcomes


* [May 31st] **From problems to R-code**

At the end of the session the students will be able to:

1.	Translate problems into pseudo-code.
2.	Translate pseudo-code into R-code.
3.	Explain what branches and loops are.
4.	Explode the properties of R to optimize loops
5.	Use the R functions lapply, vapply, etc. to speed-up code.
