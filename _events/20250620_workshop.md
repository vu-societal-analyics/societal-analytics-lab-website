title: "[hybrid]R-Workshop: Servers and Code-parallelization in R"
date: 2025-05-20
---

This is the last workshop in the R-series. The final session will focus on using servers for parallel processing. During this session, we will use all the learnings from "Basic concepts before code-parallelization in R" to speed up codes using computing servers. These workshops are open to all academics (from PhD students, to Lecturers, and Professors). 

**When:** Friday, June 20th from 9.30 to 12.00 hrs.

**Where:** 

* Onsite: If more than 4 people register onsite, otherwise, will be fully online.
* Online: The Zoom link will be sent via email.

## Requirements

* It is necessary to have R and RStudio installed before the session. You can do it from here: [https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).

* It is necessary to have knowledge of the topics covered during "Basic concepts before code-parallelization in R". You can check the material [here](https://github.com/SofiaG1l/R_Course/tree/master/R4SocialScientists/Session10_Servers_and_Parallelizing).

## Learning Outcomes


* [June 20th] **Servers and Code-parallelization in R**

At the end of the session the students will be able to:

1.	Use VU JupyterHub to run R-scripts.
2.	Identify processes that can be parallelized.
3.	Use different R-functions to parallelize.
4.	Determine whether parallelizing is beneficial to their problem.
