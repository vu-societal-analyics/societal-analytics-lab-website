## Requirements

* It is necessary to have R and RStudio installed before the session. You can do it from here: [https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).

* It is necessary to know the basics of data handling and text analytics. In February and March, we covered these topics, so you can check the material here: [https://github.com/SofiaG1l/R_Course/tree/master/R4SocialScientists](https://github.com/SofiaG1l/R_Course/tree/master/R4SocialScientists)

## Learning Outcomes

* [April 25th] **Unsupervised Machine Learning**

  At the end of the session the students will be able to:
  1.	Explain what machine learning is.
  2.	Explain the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning.
  3.	Perform dimensionality reduction.
  4.	Visualize dimensionality reduction and interpret it.
  5.	Perform clustering.
  6.	Apply unsupervised machine learning to textual problem.

* [May 2nd] **Supervised Machine Learning**

  At the end of the session the students will be able to:
  1.	Explain when to use linear regression and classification.
  2.	Train a classifier using logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, and K-nearest neighbors.
  3.	Use resampling methods to validate their models.
  4.	Use tree-based methods to classify.
  5.	Apply supervised machine learning to a real problem.
